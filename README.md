# Libraries used in this project

## Hilt
I choosed Hilt for dependency injection as it was mentioned in official Android documentation. 

## Coroutines and Flow
I used to do reactive programming with RxJava, but here I wanted to take a look at Coroutines and Flow
from kotlin which I never used before.

## Room
I used Room for the persistence layer as the integration seems pretty straight forward.
